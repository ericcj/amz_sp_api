  # unit tests for create_upload_destination_for_resource
  # Creates an upload destination, returning the information required to upload a file to the destination and to programmatically access the file.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 10 | 10 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values than those shown here. For more information, see [Usage Plans and Rate Limits in the Selling Partner API](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/usage-plans-and-rate-limits-in-the-sp-api).
  # @param marketplace_ids A list of marketplace identifiers. This specifies the marketplaces where the upload will be available. Only one marketplace can be specified.
  # @param content_md5 An MD5 hash of the content to be submitted to the upload destination. This value is used to determine if the data has been corrupted or tampered with during transit.
  # @param resource The resource for the upload destination that you are creating. For example, if you are creating an upload destination for the createLegalDisclosure operation of the Messaging API, the &#x60;{resource}&#x60; would be &#x60;/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure&#x60;, and the entire path would be &#x60;/uploads/2020-11-01/uploadDestinations/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure&#x60;. If you are creating an upload destination for an Aplus content document, the &#x60;{resource}&#x60; would be &#x60;aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments&#x60; and the path would be &#x60;/uploads/v1/uploadDestinations/aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments&#x60;.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :content_type The content type of the file to be uploaded.
  # @return [CreateUploadDestinationResponse]
