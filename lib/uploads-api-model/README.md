### Build a gem

To build the Ruby code into a gem:

```shell
gem build uploads-api-model.gemspec
```

Then either install the gem locally:

```shell
gem install ./uploads-api-model-0.1.0.gem
```
(for development, run `gem install --dev ./uploads-api-model-0.1.0.gem` to install the development dependencies)

or publish the gem to a gem hosting service, e.g. [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).

Finally add this to the Gemfile:

    gem 'uploads-api-model', '~> 0.1.0'

### Install from Git

If the Ruby gem is hosted at a git repository: https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID, then add the following in the Gemfile:

    gem 'uploads-api-model', :git => 'https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git'

### Include the Ruby code directly

Include the Ruby code directly using `-I` as follows:

```shell
ruby -Ilib script.rb
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) procedure and then run the following code:
```ruby
# Load the gem
require 'uploads-api-model'

api_instance = AmzSpApi::UploadsApiModel::UploadsApi.new
marketplace_ids = ['marketplace_ids_example'] # Array<String> | A list of marketplace identifiers. This specifies the marketplaces where the upload will be available. Only one marketplace can be specified.
content_md5 = 'content_md5_example' # String | An MD5 hash of the content to be submitted to the upload destination. This value is used to determine if the data has been corrupted or tampered with during transit.
resource = 'resource_example' # String | The resource for the upload destination that you are creating. For example, if you are creating an upload destination for the createLegalDisclosure operation of the Messaging API, the `{resource}` would be `/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure`, and the entire path would be `/uploads/2020-11-01/uploadDestinations/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure`. If you are creating an upload destination for an Aplus content document, the `{resource}` would be `aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments` and the path would be `/uploads/v1/uploadDestinations/aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments`.
opts = { 
  content_type: 'content_type_example' # String | The content type of the file to be uploaded.
}

begin
  result = api_instance.create_upload_destination_for_resource(marketplace_ids, content_md5, resource, opts)
  p result
rescue AmzSpApi::UploadsApiModel::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling UploadsApi->create_upload_destination_for_resource: #{e}"
end
```
