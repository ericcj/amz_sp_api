#Selling Partner API for Easy Ship

#The Selling Partner API for Easy Ship helps you build applications that help sellers manage and ship Amazon Easy Ship orders.  Your Easy Ship applications can:  * Get available time slots for packages to be scheduled for delivery.  * Schedule, reschedule, and cancel Easy Ship orders.  * Print labels, invoices, and warranties.  See the [Marketplace Support Table](doc:easyship-api-v2022-03-23-use-case-guide#marketplace-support-table) for the differences in Easy Ship operations by marketplace.
