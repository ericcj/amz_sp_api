#Selling Partner API for Product Type Definitions

#The Selling Partner API for Product Type Definitions provides programmatic access to attribute and data requirements for product types in the Amazon catalog. Use this API to return the JSON Schema for a product type that you can then use with other Selling Partner APIs, such as the Selling Partner API for Listings Items, the Selling Partner API for Catalog Items, and the Selling Partner API for Feeds (for JSON-based listing feeds).  For more information, see the [Product Type Definitions API Use Case Guide](doc:product-type-api-use-case-guide).

  # unit tests for get_definitions_product_type
  # Retrieve an Amazon product type definition.  **Usage Plans:**  | Plan type | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | ---- | |Default| 5 | 10 | |Selling partner specific| Variable | Variable |  The x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation. Rate limits for some selling partners will vary from the default rate and burst shown in the table above. For more information, see [Usage Plans and Rate Limits in the Selling Partner API](doc:usage-plans-and-rate-limits-in-the-sp-api).
  # @param product_type The Amazon product type name.
  # @param marketplace_ids A comma-delimited list of Amazon marketplace identifiers for the request. Note: This parameter is limited to one marketplaceId at this time.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :seller_id A selling partner identifier. When provided, seller-specific requirements and values are populated within the product type definition schema, such as brand names associated with the selling partner.
  # @option opts [String] :product_type_version The version of the Amazon product type to retrieve. Defaults to \&quot;LATEST\&quot;,. Prerelease versions of product type definitions may be retrieved with \&quot;RELEASE_CANDIDATE\&quot;. If no prerelease version is currently available, the \&quot;LATEST\&quot; live version will be provided.
  # @option opts [String] :requirements The name of the requirements set to retrieve requirements for.
  # @option opts [String] :requirements_enforced Identifies if the required attributes for a requirements set are enforced by the product type definition schema. Non-enforced requirements enable structural validation of individual attributes without all the required attributes being present (such as for partial updates).
  # @option opts [String] :locale Locale for retrieving display labels and other presentation details. Defaults to the default language of the first marketplace in the request.
  # @return [ProductTypeDefinition]
