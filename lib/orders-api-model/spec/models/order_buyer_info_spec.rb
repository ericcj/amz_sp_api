#The Selling Partner API for Orders helps you programmatically retrieve order information. These APIs let you develop fast, flexible, custom applications in areas like order synchronization, order research, and demand-based decision support tools. The Orders API only supports orders that are less than two years old. Orders more than two years old will not show in the API response.
