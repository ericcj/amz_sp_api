#Selling Partner API for Messaging

#With the Messaging API you can build applications that send messages to buyers. You can get a list of message types that are available for an order that you specify, then call an operation that sends a message to the buyer for that order. The Messaging API returns responses that are formed according to the <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08>JSON Hypertext Application Language</a> (HAL) standard.
