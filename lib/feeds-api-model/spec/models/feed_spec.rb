#Selling Partner API for Feeds

#Effective **June 27, 2023**, the Selling Partner API for Feeds v2020-09-04 will no longer be available and all calls to it will fail. Integrations that rely on the Feeds API must migrate to [Feeds v2021-06-30](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/feeds-api-v2021-06-30-reference) to avoid service disruption.
